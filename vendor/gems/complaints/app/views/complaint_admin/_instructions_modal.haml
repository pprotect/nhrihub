        %h5 File format
        %ul
          %li File must be an Excel workbook with a single worksheet, that has been saved in .csv format.
          %li If the Excel file contains multiple worksheets, please split them into multiple workbooks, and validate them separately.
          %li The column headings must be the same as the list in the "select column" dropdown.
        %h5 Validating the data
        %ul
          %li Because of the large amount of data, and the large proportion that needs to have its format normalised, the validation is performed on a column-by-column basis.
          %li When you select a column to validate, the required data pattern is explained. Eventually all columns must validate with zero errors. In order for a column to validate, some of its contents may have to be removed and placed into a new column. In this case, please contact the developer so that validation for the new column can be added to the validation tool.
          %li 
            The workflow for normalizing the data is
            %ul
              %li Choose a file, and select a column to validate.
              %li Click 'Validate'.
              %li Study the errors in the spreadsheet of errors that is produced.
              %li Fix the errors in the Excel file, so that the data matches the patterns described.
              %li Save the Excel file as a .csv file.
              %li Repeat until zero errors are reported.
