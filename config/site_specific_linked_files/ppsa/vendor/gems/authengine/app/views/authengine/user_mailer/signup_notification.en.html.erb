<p>An account has been created so that you can access the NHRI Hub demonstration and evaluation database.</p>
<p>Please click <a id='activate_link' href='<%= @url %>'>here</a> to activate your account. You will be asked to select a login name and password.</p>
<p>The database has been populated with simulated data, so that you can get a feel for how to navigate and view the contents.</p>
<p>Once your account is established, please feel free to experiment, add or delete any content that you wish. This is your sandbox to see how the database works, there is nothing you can break here! Please do not put any private or sensitive data or documents here, other people who are evaluating the database will see it.</p>
<p>Periodically the database will be cleaned, and a fresh set of simulated data installed.</p>
